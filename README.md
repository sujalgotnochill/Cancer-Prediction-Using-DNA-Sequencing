# Cancer Prediction using DNA Sequencing

Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) serves as the fundamental repository of genetic information within living organisms. In recent years, advancements in high-throughput sequencing technologies have revolutionized our ability to read DNA sequences rapidly and cost-effectively. This breakthrough has paved the way for innovative applications, including disease prediction based on genetic data.

### Libraries: The project utilizes the following libraries:

•	TensorFlow: Deep learning framework for building and training the CNN model.
•	Keras: High-level API built on top of TensorFlow for easier model development.
•	NumPy: Used for numerical computations and image manipulation.
•	Matplotlib: Used for plotting training and validation curves.
•	Scikit-learn: Provides functions for model evaluation metrics.

### Project Summary

Due to lack of computation I made this model using google colab and wasn't able to make a complete web application.
